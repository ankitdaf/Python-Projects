This is a quick script to help a friend read data over the Bluetooth SPP profile sent by the GT-750 GPS Bluetooth Receiver module.

This reads the data stream and writes it to a log file. 

I am not responsible for the comments, I was sleepy at the time.

The log file generated breaks from its nicely formatted display after a while, but nothing too serious that cannot be handled by simple cleaning up.
I of course was too sleepy to bother at that time.
