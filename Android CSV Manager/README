If you sync your Android phone contacts with Twitter, Facebook and Gmail, you know how many duplicate, invalid or useless entries creep in.

It also bloats the memory used, in my case to 25MB worth of contacts.No one should ever have to live with that.

So I created this simple set of tools which help to clean up the CSV file generated by "Export Contacts to SD Card" from the Android Contacts stock application

This tool currently allows you to :

1. Remove photos stored in plain-text
2. Cleanup trash fields
3. Remove URLs to Google profile links 
4. Remove contacts which dont' have associated phone numbers
5. Remove addresses
6. Standardise phone number formats

More features to be added.
