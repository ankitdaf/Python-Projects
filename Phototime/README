I created this project mainly because I take photos extensively for my
photolog and like them to be saved with the timestamp as the filename so that
they can be accessed quickly later.

This script will rename all the files of the supplied type in a specified directory **RECURSIVELY** as the date and time of their creation.

**BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL** 
If you want to rename files only in the current directory, make sure you give the path to the child directory.
Consider this enough warning.

I have made this generic for all file types. It will work nicely for any file type
Just enter the file type as the last command line argument. Case is important ( As of now ;) )
Whitespaces have been taken care of

How To :

Just type the following command in the terminal :

python phototime.py /path/to/your/photo/folder File_extension_without_preceding_dot


Wishlist :

-Make the code independent of case
-Add support for extension using * instead of specifying extension
